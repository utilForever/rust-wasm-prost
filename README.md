This repository is a simple code for checking crate 'prost' on WebAssembly (ü¶Ä + üï∏Ô∏è = üíñ).

## What is `prost`?

`prost` is a [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) implementation for the [Rust Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/). `prost` generates simple, idiomatic Rust code from `proto2` and `proto3` files.

## How to serialize/deserialize Protocol Buffers data?

1. Byte Stream: Check `src/example_byte_stream.rs` and `www/example_byte_stream.ts`.
2. JSON: Check `src/example_json.rs` and `www/example_json.ts`.

## Protocol Buffers Struct in Example

You can see in `proto` folder.

### Simple

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

package rust_wasm_prost.simple;

message Student {
  string name = 1;
  int32 age = 2;
  float height = 3;
  float weight = 4;
  repeated int32 grades = 5;
}
```

### Complex

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

package rust_wasm_prost.complex;

message FruitCondition {
  repeated float brix = 1;
  string origin = 2;
}

message VegetableCondition {
  repeated string nutrients = 1;
  string origin = 2;
}

message Item {
  int32 unique_id = 1;

  message Information {
    string name = 1;
    int32 count = 2;

    enum Type {
      FRUIT = 0;
      VEGETABLE = 1;
    }
    Type type = 3;
  }
  Information information = 2;

  oneof condition {
    FruitCondition fruit_condition = 3;
    VegetableCondition vegetable_condition = 4;
  }
}

```

## Requirements

* [The Rust Toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/)
* [prost](https://github.com/tokio-rs/prost)
* [serde](https://serde.rs/)
* [ts-protoc-gen](https://github.com/improbable-eng/ts-protoc-gen)
* [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started)

## Quick Start

### Rust + WebAssembly

1. Run this command inside the project directory:

```sh
wasm-pack build
```

### WebAssembly with TypeScript

1. Ensure that the local development server and its dependencies are installed by running this command within the `www` subdirectory:
```sh
npm install
```

2. Run this command from within the `www` subdirectory:
```sh
npm run start
```

3. Go to `http://localhost:8080/`
